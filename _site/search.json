The number of rows should correspond to the number of available items.\n\nOne column must contain the item labels, labelled ItemLabel.\nA second column must contain the item texts, labelled Item.\nSubsequent columns must contain the response options, labeled Choice1, Choice2, and so on, up to the number of available choices.\nNote: In this version, all items must have the same number of response options.\nOne column labelled Scores must contain the item scores. A possible format for a dichotomous item with 4 response options could be 0100 indicating that the second response option is scored as 1 (e.g., correct answer). For polytomous items the scores should range from 0 up to the total number o categories minus 1, e.g., 0123 for 4 response options.\nSubsequent columns started with the letter a correspond to the IRT discrimination (slope) parameters.\nFor a unidimensional structure, there is only one parameter, labelled a1.\nFor multidimensional structures, a1 corresponds to the first factor, a2 to the second factor, and so on.\nSimilarly, columns started with the letter d correspond to the IRT difficulty (location or intercept) parameters.\nFor a unidimensional structure, there is only one parameter, labelled d.\nFor multidimensional structures, d1 corresponds to the first threshold, d2 to the second threshold, and so on, up to the number of available thresholds.\n\n\n\nIn this example we create an itembank for the PHQ-9 questionnaire. The PHQ-9 consists of nine items measuring depression symptoms with four ordered response options.

    "text": "In this step, we show you how to set up a basic Qualtrics test/survey and connect it to the test specifications from steps 1 and 2 of this tutorial. We use the Dutch-English vocabulary test of 36 dichotomous items as an example (https://osf.io/ymh3d/files/sk9hx), with the following specifications:\n\n\n\nTest name\nTCAT\n\n\nPersonal key\ntest\n\n\n\nIt is a variable length CAT calibrated under a 2PL model. The stopping criterion is set to 0.33meaning that the test will stop when the standard error of the latent trait estimate reaches 0.33 or lower.\n\nStep 3.1 - Setup Block\nEnter the Qualtrics website and log in with your credentials.\nGo to Home page — Create a new project — Survey — and click Get started.\nEnter a Name for the Qualtrics project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Qualtric project name is not the same as the Test name you specified on this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you create a new project, select Add a new question.\nFrom the left panel, under Question Type, choose Text entry type of question.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the question text to ‘Enter Test/Survey name’.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking on the three dots menu on the right corner of the new question, select Copy to create a similar question type.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the question text to ’Enter key’ at the second question.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two questions belong to a single block, which will be the first block in your test. This block is crucial, as it links the Qualtrics survey to the correct test specifications you set up in Steps 1 and 2.\nRename the first Block as ‘Setup’ block, by changing the label above the first question.\n\nThen, for the ’Enter Test/Survey Name’ question, select Add requirements and Force response under the response Requirements options on the left panel.\nRepeat for the ’Enter Key’ question.\n\nThen, select ‘Default choices’ from the options on the left panel. Enter the name of your test in the first question, and click ‘Save’. (For this tutorial paste TCAT)\nThen repeat the process for the second question, entering the personal key that was generated previously. (For this tutorial paste test)\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.2 Introduction Block (optional)\n\nAdd a new block by selecting Add Block\nRename the new block as ‘Intro’\nAdd new question to the block by selecting ’Add new question’\nand then ‘Text / Graphic’ type\n\n\nThis does not serve as an actual question; rather, it displays all the necessary information for the test user. You can use it to introduce your test before item administration starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can add new questions to the ‘Intro’ block. For example, you could add a single-choice question to ask for informed consent.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.2 Extra Block (optional)\nSimilarly, you can add an additional block, here labelled as ‘Extra’ block , with additional questions that you would like to appear before the actual CAT survey. These may be demographic or other personal questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNo CAT methods are configured for the ‘Extra’ bolck. All users will be asked the same questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example below, the ‘Extra Block’ consists of two questions: One is for gender and the other is for age.\n\n\n\nStep 3.3 CAT Initialization Block\nSimilarly,\n\nwe add a new block,\nrename it to ‘init block’\nadd a new Text / Entry question type,\nand enter the phrase ‘Loading…’ as question text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the ‘Loading…’ question, select the ’Javascript’ option from the left panel.\n\n\nA new window will appear as shown below.\n\nReplace the default lines of code with the script below and click ‘Save’:\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() {\n    // CALL\n    fetch(\"https://qualcat.duckdns.org/api/v0/init\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      \"x-api-key\": \"${q://QID2/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\", // passwrd\n      \"userid\": \"$${e://Field/RecipientID}\", // username\n      \"catName\": \"${q://QID1/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\" // CAT name\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(answers)\n  })\n  .then(response =&gt; response.json())\n  .then(data =&gt; {\n    console.log(\"API returned:\", data); // Debug\n    // Store the API result in Embedded Data\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"stop_crit\", data.stop_crit);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"next_q\", data.next_q);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"item_num\", data.item_num);\n    var arr = data.choices;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n        var varName = \"choice\" + (i + 1);\n        Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(varName, arr[i]);\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(\"API error:\", err));\n\n    //Hides the next button and displays the question\n    //for # seconds before moving to the next page\n    // from Qualtrics documentation\n    this.hideNextButton();\n    var that = this;\n    (function(){that.clickNextButton();}).delay(4);\n});\n\n\nStep 3.4 Question Block\nAdd a new block, labelled as ‘Question Block’.\nThen, add a Multiple choice question type.\n\n\nSelect Choices from the left panel and choose the number of response options for your test under Number of choices. Here is set to 4.\nReplace the ‘Click to write the question text’ with this line ${e://Field/next_q}\nReplace the ‘Click to write Choice 1’ with ${e://Field/choice1},‘Click to write Choice 2’ with ${e://Field/choice2} . Repeat this process for each of the available choices.\n\n\nNext, if you would like the questions to be randomly administered, select ’Choice Randomization’ on the left panel.\n\nThen choose ‘Display answers in a random order’ and click ‘Save’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip for maximum performance tests: When you make the item bank in Step 2, it is covinient to paste all the correct answers into column Choice1 and make the Scores column the same for all the items (e.g. 1000 for dichotomous items). Then, when you come to this step, you can choose ‘Display answers in a random order’.\n\n\nNext, for the same question in Question Block, click the ‘Javascript’ button on the left panel, erase the default script, paste the following and click ‘Save’:\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() {\n\n    // 1. clear Qualtrics internal answer\n    this.setChoiceValue(\"\", false);\n\n    // 2. clear any recorded choice values\n    var choices = this.getChoices();\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; choices.length; i++) {\n        this.setChoiceValue(choices[i], false);\n    }\n\n    // 3. clear UI radios\n    jQuery(\"#\" + this.questionId + \" input[type='radio']\").prop(\"checked\", false);\n});\n\n\nStep 3.5 - Main CAT Block\n\nSimilarly, add a new question block named ‘cat block’\nAdd a Text/Graphic type of question,\nand replace the question text with an empty space.\nThen, click Javascript, erase everything and add the following JS code\n\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function()\n{\n     let answers = {\n    q_resp: \"${q://QID6/SelectedChoicesRecode}\",\n    item_num: \"${e://Field/item_num}\"\n  };\n  \n  console.log(\"API sent:\", answers);\n    // CALL\n    fetch(\"https://qualcat.duckdns.org/api/v0/cat\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n         \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      \"x-api-key\": \"${q://QID2/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\", // passwrd\n      \"userid\": \"$${e://Field/RecipientID}\", // username\n      \"catName\": \"${q://QID1/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\" // CAT name\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(answers)\n  })\n  .then(res =&gt; res.json())\n  .then(data =&gt; {\n    console.log(\"API returned:\", data); // Debug\n    // Store the API result in Embedded Data\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"iter\", data.iter);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"next_q\", data.item);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"item_num\", data.item_num);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"se_thetahat\", data.se_thetahat);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"thetahat\", data.thetahat);  \n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"pat\", data.pat);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"J\", data.pat.length);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"adm_items\", data.iter);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"stop\", data.stop); //v0.2\n    var arr = data.choices;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n        var varName = \"choice\" + (i + 1);\n        Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(varName, arr[i]);\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(\"API error:\", err));\n\n//Hides the next button and displays the question\n    //for # seconds before moving to the next page\n    // from Qualtrics documentation\n    this.hideNextButton();\n    var that = this;\n    (function(){that.clickNextButton();}).delay(1);\n\n});\n\n\nStep 3.6 - Survey Flow Setup\nClick the Survey Flow button on the left side bar.\n\nAll the question blocks we created before, should be visible in a sequential flow as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this example no ‘Extra Block’ is displayed. If you used an extra questions block, it would be visible under the ‘Intro’ block.\n\n\n\nIn the init block, click Add Below and select Group.\n\nRename the new group as ‘loop’ .\nThen click Move next to the Question Block and move it by dragging it under the Group. As such we make the Question block part of the group.\n\nRepeat for the cat block to make it part of the loop group.\nthen click + Add a New Element under the cat block, inside the group.\n\nSelect Branch\n\nClick Add a Condition\n\nSelect ‘Embedded Data’.\n\n\nEnter the word ‘stop’ for the embedded data\nSelect ‘Is Equal To’ and enter the number ‘1’\nClick OK\nAdd a New Element below the if branch\n\n\nSelect the End of Survey element\n\nThen, click the button Duplicate next to the loop group, as many times as the available total number of items.\nIn this example, the itembank consists of 36 items in total, therefore we click the button Duplicate 36 times.\n\n\nIf we zoom out we should see the loop group duplicated by 36 times.\nThen click Apply to apply this flow set up to the survey.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.7 - Publish the Test/Survey\n\nGo to ‘Survey Options’\nSelect ’Responses’\nand make sure to uncheck the radio buttons for the Back Button and Allow respondents to finish later\n\n\n\nThen go to ‘Builder’ options again, and\nclick ‘Publish’\n\n\nAfter following short instructions, the survey will be published and a unique anonymous URL will be activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The number of rows should correspond to the number of available items.\n\nOne column must contain the item labels, labelled ItemLabel.\nA second column must contain the item texts, labelled Item.\nSubsequent columns must contain the response options, labeled Choice1, Choice2, and so on, up to the number of available choices.\nNote: In this version, all items must have the same number of response options.\nOne column labelled Scores must contain the item scores. A possible format for a dichotomous item with 4 response options could be 0100 indicating that the second response option is scored as 1 (e.g., correct answer). For polytomous items the scores should range from 0 up to the total number o categories minus 1, e.g., 0123 for 4 response options.\nSubsequent columns started with the letter a correspond to the IRT discrimination (slope) parameters.\nFor a unidimensional structure, there is only one parameter, labelled a1.\nFor multidimensional structures, a1 corresponds to the first factor, a2 to the second factor, and so on.\nSimilarly, columns started with the letter d correspond to the IRT difficulty (location or intercept) parameters.\nFor a unidimensional structure, there is only one parameter, labelled d.\nFor multidimensional structures, d1 corresponds to the first threshold, d2 to the second threshold, and so on, up to the number of available thresholds.\n\n\n\nIn this example we create an itembank for the PHQ-9 questionnaire. The PHQ-9 consists of nine items measuring depression symptoms with four ordered response options. The items have been calibrated using publicly available data with a Graded Response Model.\n\n\nCode\nwd &lt;- '[PATH TO YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY]' # replace this with your working directory\n# read the blueprint item bank:\nitem_bank &lt;- read.csv(file.path(wd, \"itembank_blueprint.csv\"), colClasses = c(Scores = \"character\"))\n\n# We fill in the columns manually columnwise:\nitem_bank$ItemLabel &lt;- c(\"DPQ010\", \"DPQ020\", \"DPQ030\", \"DPQ040\", \"DPQ050\", \"DPQ060\", \"DPQ070\", \"DPQ080\", \"DPQ090\")\nitem_bank$Item &lt;- c(\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling bad about yourself or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed.

    "section": "Step 3: Qualtrics set-up",
    "text": "Step 3: Qualtrics set-up\nIn this step, we show you how to set up a basic Qualtrics test/survey and connect it to the test specifications from steps 1 and 2 of this tutorial. We use the Dutch-English vocabulary test of 36 dichotomous items as an example (https://osf.io/ymh3d/files/sk9hx), with the following specifications:\n\n\n\nTest name\nTCAT\n\n\nPersonal key\ntest\n\n\n\nIt is a variable length CAT calibrated under a 2PL model. The stopping criterion is set to 0.33meaning that the test will stop when the standard error of the latent trait estimate reaches 0.33 or lower.\n\nStep 3.1 - Setup Block\nEnter the Qualtrics website and log in with your credentials.\nGo to Home page — Create a new project — Survey — and click Get started.\nEnter a Name for the Qualtrics project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Qualtric project name is not the same as the Test name you specified on this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you create a new project, select Add a new question.\nFrom the left panel, under Question Type, choose Text entry type of question.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the question text to ‘Enter Test/Survey name’.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking on the three dots menu on the right corner of the new question, select Copy to create a similar question type.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the question text to ’Enter key’ at the second question.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two questions belong to a single block, which will be the first block in your test. This block is crucial, as it links the Qualtrics survey to the correct test specifications you set up in Steps 1 and 2.\nRename the first Block as ‘Setup’ block, by changing the label above the first question.\n\nThen, for the ’Enter Test/Survey Name’ question, select Add requirements and Force response under the response Requirements options on the left panel.\nRepeat for the ’Enter Key’ question.\n\nThen, select ‘Default choices’ from the options on the left panel. Enter the name of your test in the first question, and click ‘Save’. (For this tutorial paste TCAT)\nThen repeat the process for the second question, entering the personal key that was generated previously. (For this tutorial paste test)\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.2 Introduction Block (optional)\n\nAdd a new block by selecting Add Block\nRename the new block as ‘Intro’\nAdd new question to the block by selecting ’Add new question’\nand then ‘Text / Graphic’ type\n\n\nThis does not serve as an actual question; rather, it displays all the necessary information for the test user. You can use it to introduce your test before item administration starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can add new questions to the ‘Intro’ block. For example, you could add a single-choice question to ask for informed consent.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.2 Extra Block (optional)\nSimilarly, you can add an additional block, here labelled as ‘Extra’ block , with additional questions that you would like to appear before the actual CAT survey. These may be demographic or other personal questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNo CAT methods are configured for the ‘Extra’ bolck. All users will be asked the same questions.\n\n\n\nIn the example below, the ‘Extra Block’ consists of two questions: One is for gender and the other is for age.\n\n\n\nStep 3.3 CAT Initialization Block\nSimilarly,\n\nwe add a new block,\nrename it to ‘init block’\nadd a new Text / Entry question type,\nand enter the phrase ‘Loading…’ as question text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the ‘Loading…’ question, select the ’Javascript’ option from the left panel.\n\n\nA new window will appear as shown below.\n\nReplace the default lines of code with the script below and click ‘Save’:\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function() {\n    // CALL\n    fetch(\"https://qualcat.duckdns.org/api/v0/init\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      \"x-api-key\": \"${q://QID2/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\", // passwrd\n      \"userid\": \"${e://Field/SessionID}\", // username\n      \"catName\": \"${q://QID1/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\" // CAT name\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(answers)\n  })\n  .then(response =&gt; response.json())\n  .then(data =&gt; {\n    console.log(\"API returned:\", data); // Debug\n    // Store the API result in Embedded Data\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"stop_crit\", data.stop_crit);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"next_q\", data.next_q);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"item_num\", data.item_num);\n    var arr = data.choices;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n        var varName = \"choice\" + (i + 1);\n        Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(varName, arr[i]);\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(\"API error:\", err));\n\n    //Hides the next button and displays the question\n    //for # seconds before moving to the next page\n    // from Qualtrics documentation\n    this.hideNextButton();\n    var that = this;\n    (function(){that.clickNextButton();}).delay(4);\n});\n\n\nStep 3.4 Question Block\nAdd a new block, labelled as ‘Question Block’.\nThen, add a Multiple choice question type.\n\n\nSelect Choices from the left panel and choose the number of response options for your test under Number of choices. Here is set to 4.\nReplace the ‘Click to write the question text’ with this line ${e://Field/next_q}\nReplace the ‘Click to write Choice 1’ with ${e://Field/choice1},‘Click to write Choice 2’ with ${e://Field/choice2} . Repeat this process for each of the available choices.\n\n\nNext, click the ‘Javascript’ button on the left panel, erase the default script, paste the following and click ‘Save’:\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() {\n\n    // 1. clear Qualtrics internal answer\n    this.setChoiceValue(\"\", false);\n\n    // 2. clear any recorded choice values\n    var choices = this.getChoices();\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; choices.length; i++) {\n        this.setChoiceValue(choices[i], false);\n    }\n\n    // 3. clear UI radios\n    jQuery(\"#\" + this.questionId + \" input[type='radio']\").prop(\"checked\", false);\n});\nIf you would like the questions to be randomly administered, select ’Choice Randomization’ on the left panel.\n\nThen choose ‘Display answers in a random order’ and click ‘Save’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip for maximum performance tests: When you make the item bank in Step 2, it is convenient to paste all the correct answers into column Choice1 and make the Scores column the same for all the items (e.g. 1000 for dichotomous items). Then, when you come to this step, you can choose ‘Display answers in a random order’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor typical performance tests including Likert-type items, for example, you should not randomize the order of the response options since these appear in a fixed order.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.5 - Main CAT Block\n\nAdd a new question block named ‘cat block’\nAdd a Text/Graphic type of question,\nand replace the question text with an empty space.\nThen, click Javascript, erase everything and add the following JS code\n\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function()\n{\n     let answers = {\n    q_resp: \"${q://QID6/SelectedChoicesRecode}\",\n    item_num: \"${e://Field/item_num}\"\n  };\n  \n  console.log(\"API sent:\", answers);\n    // CALL\n    fetch(\"https://qualcat.duckdns.org/api/v0/cat\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n         \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      \"x-api-key\": \"${q://QID2/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\", // passwrd\n      \"userid\": \"${e://Field/SessionID}\", // username\n      \"catName\": \"${q://QID1/ChoiceTextEntryValue}\" // CAT name\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(answers)\n  })\n  .then(res =&gt; res.json())\n  .then(data =&gt; {\n    console.log(\"API returned:\", data); // Debug\n    // Store the API result in Embedded Data\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"iter\", data.iter);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"next_q\", data.item);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"item_num\", data.item_num);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"se_thetahat\", data.se_thetahat);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"thetahat\", data.thetahat);  \n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"pat\", data.pat);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"J\", data.pat.length);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"adm_items\", data.iter);\n    Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(\"stop\", data.stop); //v0.2\n    var arr = data.choices;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n        var varName = \"choice\" + (i + 1);\n        Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData(varName, arr[i]);\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(\"API error:\", err));\n\n//Hides the next button and displays the question\n    //for # seconds before moving to the next page\n    // from Qualtrics documentation\n    this.hideNextButton();\n    var that = this;\n    (function(){that.clickNextButton();}).delay(1);\n\n});\n\n\nStep 3.6 - Survey Flow Setup\nClick the Survey Flow button on the left side bar.\n\nAll the question blocks we created before, should be visible in a sequential flow as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this example no ‘Extra Block’ is displayed. If you used an extra questions block, it would be visible under the ‘Intro’ block.\n\n\n\nIn the init block, click Add Below and select Group.\n\nRename the new group as ‘loop’ .\nThen click Move next to the Question Block and move it by dragging it under the Group. As such we make the Question block part of the group.\n\nRepeat for the cat block to make it part of the loop group.\nthen click + Add a New Element under the cat block, inside the group.\n\nSelect Branch\n\nClick Add a Condition\n\nSelect ‘Embedded Data’.\n\n\nEnter the word ‘stop’ for the embedded data\nSelect ‘Is Equal To’ and enter the number ‘1’\nClick OK\nAdd a New Element below the if branch\n\n\nSelect the End of Survey element\n\nThen, click the button Duplicate next to the loop group, as many times as the available total number of items.\nIn this example, the itembank consists of 36 items in total, therefore we click the button Duplicate 36 times.\n\n\nIf we zoom out we should see the loop group duplicated by 36 times.\nThen click Apply to apply this flow set up to the survey.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.7 - Publish the Test/Survey\n\nGo to ‘Survey Options’\nSelect ’Responses’\nand make sure to uncheck the radio buttons for the Back Button and Allow respondents to finish later\n\n\n\nThen go to ‘Builder’ options again, and\nclick ‘Publish’\n\n\nAfter following short instructions, the survey will be published and a unique anonymous URL will be activated."

    "text": "Step 1: Upload the itembank\n\nOnce you have filled in the actual data in the itembank, you can use the field below to upload your itembank to the server.\n\n  \n    \n      Select Itembank File (.csv format)\n       \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      Submit File\n    \n  \n\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, you can use the R code below to create an itembank with polytomous items, or use MS Excel with this file for an English-Dutch vocabulary test, which includes 36 dichotomous items.\n\nDetails for the itembank structureExample itembank in RExample itembank in Excel\n\n\nThe item bank must be a .csv (Comma-Separated Values) file, with specific column names and structure. The number of rows should correspond to the number of available items.\n\nOne column must contain the item labels, labelled ItemLabel.\nA second column must contain the item texts, labelled Item.\nSubsequent columns must contain the response options, labeled Choice1, Choice2, and so on, up to the number of available choices.\nNote: In this version, all items must have the same number of response options.\nOne column labelled Scores must contain the item scores. A possible format for a dichotomous item with 4 response options could be 0100 indicating that the second response option is scored as 1 (e.g., correct answer). For polytomous items the scores should range from 0 up to the total number o categories minus 1, e.g., 0123 for 4 response options.\nSubsequent columns started with the letter a correspond to the IRT discrimination (slope) parameters.\nFor a unidimensional structure, there is only one parameter, labelled a1.\nFor multidimensional structures, a1 corresponds to the first factor, a2 to the second factor, and so on.\nSimilarly, columns started with the letter d correspond to the IRT difficulty (location or intercept) parameters.\nFor a unidimensional structure, there is only one parameter, labelled d.\nFor multidimensional structures, d1 corresponds to the first threshold, d2 to the second threshold, and so on, up to the number of available thresholds.\n\n\n\nIn this example we create an itembank for the PHQ-9 questionnaire. The PHQ-9 consists of nine items measuring depression symptoms with four ordered response options. The items have been calibrated using publicly available data with a Graded Response Model.\n\n\nCode\nwd &lt;- '[PATH TO YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY]' # replace this with your working directory\n# read the blueprint item bank:\nitem_bank &lt;- read.csv(file.path(wd, \"itembank_blueprint.csv\"), colClasses = c(Scores = \"character\"))\n\n# We fill in the columns manually columnwise:\nitem_bank$ItemLabel &lt;- c(\"DPQ010\", \"DPQ020\", \"DPQ030\", \"DPQ040\", \"DPQ050\", \"DPQ060\", \"DPQ070\", \"DPQ080\", \"DPQ090\")\nitem_bank$Item &lt;- c(\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling bad about yourself or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television\",\n  \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed.
